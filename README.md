# Bitcoin Hush

Bitcoin Hush is a Komodo Asset chain, so we need to download and compile that code,
which will allow us to connect to the BTCH network. We must also tell it a node to connect to that knows about the BTCH asset chain.

BTCH uses RPC port 10161 and a P2P port of 10160, you might need to allow them in your firewall. 

```
  git clone https://github.com/jl777/komodo
  cd komodo
  # This needs to download the Zcash Proving key, around ~1GB file
  # This is only needed *once* per user account, per machine
  ./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
  # This will take some time
  ./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)
  # this supply, with the .0001BTCH block reward every 1 minute, approaches 21M BTCH in ~25years
  ./src/komodod -ac_name=BTCH -ac_supply=20998641 -addnode=78.47.196.146 &> btch.log &
  # look at your BTCH logs 
  tail btch.log
  # get the current BTCH network info
  ./src/komodo-cli -ac_name=BTCH getinfo

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can I mine BTCH?

Mining does get a "block reward", but yes, you can earn small amounts of BTCH by helping confirm blocks, you simply add `-gen` when you start things up:

```
./src/komodod -ac_name=BTCH -ac_supply=20998641 -addnode=78.47.196.146 -gen &> btch.log &
```
Note that this will send each bit of earnings you make to a new address, which is not great. Set a `mineraddress=taddr` in your BTCH.conf to have it all go to one address. The amount you earn will be variable, as it is 0.0001 BTCH + the fees of the transactions in that block.
Also remember that KMD Asset chains have "on demand" blocks, so if no transactions happen, no block occurs and hence no confirmation rewards.
